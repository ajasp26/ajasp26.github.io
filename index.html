            <p>
              My name is Alexander Jasper, and I am a post-baccalaureate student
              at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG),
              currently in my final semester as a Computer Science major with
              career aspirations in Cybersecurity. I originally started in
              pre-medicine, but my passion for mathematics, sparked through
              physics, led me to explore new paths. In January 2022, I made the
              switch to Computer Science, and it quickly became a field I have
              grown to love.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I currently hold a 3.83 GPA and have consistently been on the
              Dean's and Chancellor's Lists since starting at UNCG. I will be
              graduating Magna Cum Laude. I am eager to
              leverage my university education, certifications, and self-study
              experience to pursue a fulfilling career as an Offensive
              Cybersecurity Engineer, with a strong interest in Malware
              Analysis.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My time outside of work and academics is spent with my dog, Ace,
              who loves soccer, fetch, bike rides, and his absolute favorite,
              swimming. Im also a self-taught pianist and A2 proficient in
              Japanese, Spanish, and Dutch.

        <span class="education-date">2022-2024/25</span>
        <h4>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</h4>
        <p>
          Technically beginning UNCG January 2020, I started my studies in the
          School of Computer Science in January 2022. I will be graduating magna
          cum laude in December 2024 and will be ready for full-time employment
          as I begin my career in cybersecurity. During my time at UNCG, I have
          logged over 100 clinical hours with Cone Health and assisted my
          physics professor in the summer of 2022 with his research into
          Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity, as well as General Relativity
          to a lesser extent. I have tutored over 150 students. I am a member of
          Phi Kappa Phi (top 7% of students across the entire university) and
          Tau Sigma (honor society for transfer students). I have been invited
          to several other honor societies, but I can only afford so many. I
          have been named to both the Dean's List and, shortly after, the
          Chancellor's List for the entirety of my time here.

              <p>
                As part of my PNPT/OSCP studies, I completed TCM's Practical
                Ethical Hacker course as part of my PNPT (Practical Network
                Penetration Tester) preparation. This course provides hands-on
                training focused on real-world tools and techniques used by
                professional ethical hackers. It covers essential topics such as
                network penetration testing, web application security, wireless
                attacks, and Active Directory exploitation. Students gain
                practical skills in Linux, Python, and note-keeping while also
                learning key concepts like reconnaissance, exploitation, and
                post-exploitation techniques. The course includes a mid-course
                capstone where there are several machine instances, ranging in
                difficulty, which they use various tools and techniques to
                compromise them. Students set up and then compromise an Active
                Directory along with performing web application penetration
                testing gaining experience with exploiting OWASP Top 10
                vulnerabilities and others.

                network scanning, enumeration, exploitation, privilege
                escalation, and web application security. Through hands-on labs
                and practical exercises, students gain experience with key tools
                like Metasploit, Burp Suite, and Nmap, while also learning how
                to document findings and generate professional reports. By the
                end of the path, learners will have a strong understanding of
                real-world penetration testing techniques and methodologies,
                preparing them for junior roles in cybersecurity.
